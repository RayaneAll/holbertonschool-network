# Computer Networks

Computer networks play a crucial role in the modern world, enabling communication and resource sharing between different systems. This document provides a general introduction to the fundamental concepts of networks.

## What is a Computer Network?

A computer network is a collection of computers and other devices connected to exchange data. These connections can be established through cables, radio waves, or other communication technologies.

## Types of Networks

1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A local network, typically confined to a small geographical area such as an office or home.
2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A wide network that spans large distances, such as the Internet.
3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A metropolitan network that covers a city or region.
4. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: A personal network used to connect individual devices like smartphones or smartwatches.

## Network Components

- **Routers**: Direct data packets between networks.
- **Switches**: Connect devices within a network and manage data traffic.
- **Access Points**: Enable wireless devices to connect to a network.
- **Cables and Connectors**: Provide physical connections between devices.
- **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**: Allow devices to connect to a network.

## Importance of Networks

Computer networks are essential for:
- Sharing resources such as files, printers, and internet connections.
- Enabling communication through emails, messaging, and video calls.
- Supporting business operations and cloud-based services.

Understanding the basics of computer networks is fundamental for anyone interested in technology or IT infrastructure.
